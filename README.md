# BUSI and LoRA Project

## Overview

This project explores Business Understandable Stochastic Independence (BUSI) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques, likely in the context of machine learning and neural network optimization.

## Project Composition

- **Language**: Jupyter Notebooks (100%)
- **Focus Areas**: BUSI methodology and LoRA implementations

## Key Concepts

### BUSI (Business Understandable Stochastic Independence)
Business-oriented approach to understanding stochastic independence in data and models, making machine learning insights more accessible and interpretable for business stakeholders.

### LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
A parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that reduces the number of trainable parameters in large models, making it more efficient to adapt pre-trained models for specific tasks.

## Contents

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook implementations demonstrating:
- BUSI methodologies and applications
- LoRA techniques and adaptations
- Integration of both approaches in practical machine learning scenarios
