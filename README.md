# Breast Ultrasound Image Classification with LoRA and DeiT

## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of breast ultrasound images utilizing advanced techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and the Vision Transformer architecture, specifically the Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT). The goal is to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer detection through effective image classification methods.

## Key Components
- **Breast Ultrasound Images**: A dataset containing labeled ultrasound images of breast tissues.
- **LoRA**: A method that reduces the computational load while maintaining model performance, specifically tailored for adapting pretrained models.
- **DeiT**: A transformer model that is efficient for image classification tasks and trained on large datasets to improve performance on smaller datasets.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
